            <h1>6.2 God's Sanctuary: The Most Holy Place and the Day of Judgment</h1>
            <p>Understanding how the Day of Atonement corresponds to the day of final judgment, when the problem of sin is definitively resolved.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="question">
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>In the previous study, we learned what the sanctuary was and what purpose it had. But we focused mainly on the services that were performed in its first part, and we defined all this as "continual service" because it referred to something that happened every day. We will now see the service that took place in the most holy place and discover what it meant and what it means for us today.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h3>1. What was special about the service performed in the most holy place?</h3>
            <span class="scripture-reference">Hebrews 9:6,7</span>
            <p>While all priests could enter the holy place continually, only the high priest could enter the most holy place once a year.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h3>2. On what occasion did this happen?</h3>
            <span class="scripture-reference">Leviticus 16:2,3,16; 23:27</span>
            <p>On the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur), the most solemn day of the Jewish calendar, on the tenth day of the seventh month (Tishri) of the biblical calendar, which corresponded to our September-October.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h3>3. What happened on that day?</h3>
            <p>Leviticus 16 narrates the entire ceremony. Let's first look at the facts. We will try to understand their meaning afterward.</p>

                    <li>The high priest had to first wash himself and, wearing his ritual garments, offer a sacrifice for himself and for his own family. In this way, pure from all sin, he could properly perform his task (vv. 1-4,6,11-14).</li>
                    <li>Two goats were chosen: one had to be offered as a sacrifice for sin, the other would be sent to Azazel in the wilderness (vv. 5-7,10). We will soon try to understand who this Azazel was.</li>
                    <li>The goat for the sacrifice was offered (v. 15 first part).</li>
                    <li>The blood of the goat was brought into the most holy place and sprinkled on the cover of the ark of the covenant. What remained was sprinkled on all the furnishings of the sanctuary and the courtyard (vv. 15 second part; 18,19).</li>
                    <li>Finally, the high priest took the goat for Azazel, placed his hands on its head, and confessed over it all the sins and transgressions of Israel. The goat was then led away from the sanctuary, with the sins it carried, into the wilderness, and abandoned far from the people (vv. 20-22).</li>

                <h4>4. From what can we deduce the special importance of this day?</h4>
                <p>In a sense, we can say that all the other days and their rituals were preparation for this extraordinary day. Its special meaning can be seen from the following facts:</p>
                
                <ol class="styled-list">
                    <li>It is the only day when the high priest enters the most holy place.</li>
                    <li>It was preceded and announced by the trumpets that were sounded ten days before, at the beginning of the month (Leviticus 23:23-27).</li>
                    <li>It is the only day for which God requires an attitude of humiliation (Leviticus 23:29-32) that the people expressed through fasting (Acts 27:9).</li>
                    <li>The penalty for not living this day with humility was exclusion from God's people (Leviticus 23:29).</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>It is evident that something extraordinary happened on such a day. What?</p>
            </div>
            
            <div id="purpose" class="tab-content">
                <h4>5. What was the purpose of this day?</h4>
                <p>The Bible expresses it in two different but concordant ways:</p>
                
                <ol class="styled-list">
                    <li>On one hand, it is said that it served to make atonement for the sins of the people (Leviticus 23:28; 16:17 first part).</li>
                    <li>On the other hand, we read that it served to purify the sanctuary from all the sins and impurities of the people (Leviticus 16:16,20).</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h3>6. Why did the sanctuary need to be purified?</h3>
            <p>If it had to be purified "because of" their sins and impurities, it is evident that in some way it had been contaminated by these sins. How? The answer can be found in what we saw in the previous study: when sins were confessed through sacrifice, they were brought into the sanctuary through their blood or their flesh (Leviticus 10:17,18). This had a double effect: the sin was forgiven to the sinner, it was removed from him but, at the same time, it was brought into the sanctuary and left there. In this way, sins, even if forgiven, contaminated the sanctuary which had to, toward the end of the religious year, be purified. The Day of Atonement (purification) had precisely this purpose.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h3>7. What does it mean that one had to humble oneself if one did not want to be "cut off" from the people?</h3>
            <span class="scripture-reference">Leviticus 23:29</span>
            <p>This expression can have a physical meaning: those who manifestly assumed a disrespectful, arrogant attitude, contrary to the humility that such a day required, were excluded from God's people and perhaps killed or simply removed from the community. But, since only God can know the true attitude of hearts, only God could spiritually exclude these people from the work of purification that the Day of Atonement involved. Ultimately, they rejected God's grace, remained in their sins, and for this reason were no longer considered part of God's people.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h3>8. Seventh-day Adventists understand this day as a day of judgment. Why?</h3>
            <p>Based on what we have seen, the Day of Atonement was the synthesis and conclusion of the entire sacrificial system. Every day sinners could obtain forgiveness for their sins, but these did not completely disappear: a memory remained before God, and this required a solution. This was offered by the Day of Atonement: the sanctuary and the people were purified, and their sins carried away to Azazel in the wilderness. However, this benefit was valid only for those who manifested a humble attitude; the others were themselves removed from the sanctuary and from the people. In this respect, the Day of Atonement operated a separation between the true and false people of God, and this is equivalent to a work of judgment. Considering that the sanctuary rituals are a representation of the history of redemption, this judgment toward the end of the year must correspond to what we call the final judgment.</p>
            
            <p>In other terms: the entire sanctuary and its rituals is a shadow, a symbol, of the heavenly sanctuary and the Christian reality (Hebrews 8:5). As the continual service corresponds to Christ's continual intercession on behalf of His people in the heavenly sanctuary, so the Day of Atonement represents the final judgment preached by Christ and the apostles.</p>
            
            <p>In this final judgment, the sins of those whose names will remain in the book of life will be definitively taken away, and the entire heavenly sanctuary and God's people are definitively purified, and their definitive and eternal salvation is proclaimed (Daniel 7:18 where the judgment is "in favor of the saints," not "given to the saints"; Revelation 11:18).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h3>9. Can we find other biblical elements on this idea that a memory of our sins, even of those forgiven, is kept until the day of judgment?</h3>
            
            <ol class="styled-list">
                <li>The Bible says that books are written to preserve the memory of our entire life, and that these books are opened on the day of judgment (Daniel 7:10; Malachi 3:16; Revelation 20:12).</li>
                <li>The Bible says that it is not enough to confess our sins to be saved. We must also persevere in God's grace until the end of our days (Matthew 24:13).</li>
                <li>The Bible says that there is a final judgment for all men, even for those who are part of God's people (1 Peter 4:17), that is, those who have already confessed their sin and received forgiveness thanks to Jesus. Peter even says that God's judgment begins with these latter, before moving on to others, which we will see is reflected in two different phases of judgment.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>In other words, being forgiven today does not guarantee our final destiny. One can confess one's sin today and enter into salvation, but tomorrow one can deny Jesus: the forgiveness of past sin will not be enough to make one enjoy eternal salvation. That is why there is a final judgment.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h3>10. What is the meaning of the goat for Azazel?</h3>
            <p>The meaning of the word "Azazel" is unknown. It is clear, however, that it refers to someone or something not in harmony with God. God is in the sanctuary while Azazel is in the wilderness; sins are taken away from God's presence and from the people and sent to Azazel who is alone in the wilderness. It is therefore easy to think that Azazel is a way of referring to Satan, the first responsible for the sins of all humanity, to whom, in the end, all the sins of God's children will be sent back. We know that after the judgment and the return of Jesus, Satan will be confined for a time in solitary exile (see study on the millennium). The similarity with the reality of Azazel is impressive.</p>
            
            <p>More difficult is understanding the role of the second goat on which all the sins of the people are confessed. Many Christians believe that this goat also represents Jesus. As Adventists, we find this interpretation difficult because, while it is true that Jesus died for our sins, we cannot understand in what sense He should take all our sins upon Himself again after having already done so on the cross, after He has already purified the sanctuary, as the goat for Azazel does. The functions of the two goats are opposite: while one purifies, the other contaminates (Leviticus 16:26). For this reason, Adventists normally refuse to see in this second goat a symbol of Jesus as well. Who is it then? It is not necessary that it must represent someone. It can simply be a plastic symbol that makes visible the fact that somehow, in the end, God will make all sins fall on Satan's head.</p>

            <h3>12. Can we know when the final judgment symbolized by the Day of Atonement takes place?</h3>
            <p>Yes, at least we can know when it begins, but not the moment when it ends because, as Jesus says, only the Father knows the day of His return (Matthew 24:36) with which the end of the judgment coincides (Daniel 7:9-10,13-14). To know the initial moment, we must turn to the prophetic book of Daniel, which we will begin to do with the next study. It will not be something simple, because God also let the prophet know that only in the last times, and only those who carefully study this book, will be able to understand it (Daniel 12:4), but if we really want to understand, God will certainly help us.</p>

                <summary>14. On the Day of Atonement, why does no confession of sins occur on the head of the goat for the Lord?</summary>
                <div class="details-content">
                    <p>Because the sins that are removed from the sanctuary on this day had already been confessed on the heads of animals previously offered in sacrifice, during the days of the "continual service." The sacrifice of the goat, a symbol of Jesus, during the Day of Atonement thus expresses the other aspect of the sacrifice for sin: on one hand, the sacrifice-Jesus takes upon Himself the sin of the sinner and dies from it, but on the other hand, He has the power to purify the sinner. This second value was already expressed in the sacrifice for sin, since the sinner was forgiven, but now it is applied to the whole people as an expression of the fact that in the final judgment, purification is always obtained thanks to Christ's sacrifice. For this reason, there is no confession of sins on the goat for the Lord, while there will be, but with another meaning and with other consequences, on the goat for Azazel. This fact also helps us understand that the sins taken away during the Day of Atonement are actually the sins already previously confessed and brought into the sanctuary through the sacrifices for sin, not other sins; otherwise, we would not understand why this sacrifice "for sin" (v. 9) is not associated with the rite of laying on of hands and confession as usually happened.</p>

Only at the end of the ritual, when the purification has already occurred, does the goat for Azazel enter the scene, but only passively, to receive on its head the sins that were removed from the sanctuary and carry them away. Only in this sense does it contribute to purification.</p>

                <summary>16. When we read the letter to the Hebrews, it seems that everything the Old Testament sanctuary represented was fulfilled through the death and current ministry of Jesus in the heavenly sanctuary. Doesn't this contradict the idea that the Day of Atonement represents something specifically distinct like the day of judgment?</summary>
                <div class="details-content">
                    <p>We do not believe it is so. To understand the letter to the Hebrews, we must understand that its main purpose is pastoral, not prophetic. The writer simply wants to help Christians, still tied to the earthly sanctuary and its rituals, to understand that everything was a symbol of Jesus Christ and the Christian economy and that therefore, having the reality, we must not be nostalgic for the old symbols. To achieve this goal, he does not analyze all the prophetic meanings of the sanctuary, but only what can serve them, in relation to the experience they were living, so that they could trust Jesus with full confidence. The question of the final judgment is barely mentioned (6:2; 9:27; 10:27-30), but is never treated at length.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Day of Atonement is never mentioned and analyzed as such. Consequently, we cannot say anything about the prophetic interpretation that the writer might have given of it. It is mentioned only indirectly through the mention of goats or calves (Hebrews 9:12) that we find mentioned together in Leviticus 16:3,5; and in 9:24-28 where Jesus is contrasted with the "high priest, who enters the most holy place every year with blood that is not his own" (v. 25). In both cases, the idea is not to analyze the specific meaning of the Day of Atonement, but only to affirm the fact of the repetitiveness of Jewish rituals, and thus their non-real effectiveness, in opposition to the fact that Jesus offers Himself once for all, definitively solving the problem of our sin. To convey this message, he compares and contrasts Jesus with all the sacrifices of the sanctuary, without distinguishing between those of the continual service and those of the Day of Atonement because this is not part of the objectives he aims to achieve.</p>
                    
                    <p>The author of Hebrews mentions every type of sacrifice and situation, mixing together (9:12,13) calves, goats, but also the red heifer (Numbers 10:2) which had nothing to do with the Day of Atonement. He can do this only because he does not want to discuss each type of sacrifice or each type of situation in itself, but the overall fact that everything pointed to Jesus. The death of Jesus is particularly emphasized because all of Jesus' ministry and our salvation are founded on it.</p>
                    
                    <p>With the writer of Hebrews, we too can say that the entire Old Testament sanctuary pointed to the cross, because without the cross there is neither forgiveness, nor salvation, nor purification of the sanctuary, nor final judgment, nor eternity for God's people. The cross is present in the Day of Atonement and in the final judgment, but this does not mean that the cross and the final judgment are the same thing. The latter is based on the cross but comes a long time after it. The same letter to the Hebrews (9:27-28) (right at the end of the chapter that begins with the distinction between the holy place and the most holy place), distinguishes between the moment of Jesus' sacrifice, applied to all Christians who live throughout the course of the Christian era, and the future day of judgment. It is easy to see in this a hint at the distinction we have tried to outline. However, to know the time of this judgment, we must leave the pastoral perspective of Hebrews and turn to the prophetic book of Daniel. We will do this in the next studies.</p>

                <summary>17. Seventh-day Adventists believe that the distinction between the holy place and the most holy place of the earthly sanctuary corresponds to a distinction in the heavenly sanctuary. They say that, at His ascension, Jesus entered the holy place and that in the antitypical Day of Atonement, He will pass into the most holy place. If this were true, how do we explain what we read in many New Testament texts where it says that Jesus placed Himself at the right hand of God on the very day of His resurrection? (Mark 16:19; Acts 7:56; Romans 8:34; Colossians 3:1; Hebrews 1:3...)</summary>
                <div class="details-content">
                    <p>The problem arises only because of the language we use. The early Adventists wanted to emphasize the correspondence between the two sanctuaries. To do this, they used very literalistic language based on the structure of the earthly sanctuary. This fact can, however, create some misunderstanding that they perhaps weren't even aware of because their attention was drawn to something else. In reality, beyond the language used, what they wanted to express was not a spatial correspondence but a functional one. After the resurrection, Jesus began a ministry that corresponded to what was represented by the holy place. Toward the end of time, He then begins a ministry that was symbolized by what happened in the most holy place. It was therefore easy to express the passage from the first to the second ministry as if it corresponded to the passage from the first to the second room of the sanctuary. However, in reality, Jesus can do all this while being at the right hand of God because, in reality, everything that happened in the sanctuary happened in the presence of God, regardless of the room in which it occurred.</p>
                    
                    <p>In the earthly sanctuary, even the furnishings of the courtyard (Leviticus 1:5,11; 16:18; 3:1: 4:4...) and the holy place (Leviticus 4:6,7...), and the rituals that took place there were "before the LORD." The veil that separated the holy place from the most holy place was placed there as a sign of separation, of distinction between the two places (Exodus 26:33) but not to isolate the two spaces. The veil served to mark the two phases of the sanctuary service, but also to express respect for the presence of the Lord that was manifested above the ark placed in the most holy place (in the heavenly sanctuary, there is evidently no need for such a distinction because nothing sinful prevents direct access to the holiness and majesty of God). We can understand even better the consistency of this idea when considering Solomon's temple: while everything was in masonry, only the veil remained as such: the two rooms thus appeared as a single room. However, the two types of service ("continual" and "annual") were clearly distinct. Consider also what we have seen about the altar of incense that "belonged" to the most holy place even though it was placed in the holy place (Hebrews 9:2).</p>
                    
                    <p>It is also interesting that in addition to the two carved cherubim placed above the ark and the figures that were on the veil of separation (Exodus 26:31), all the curtains of the sanctuary were adorned with such figures (Exodus 26:1). These cherubim evidently represent the heavenly court of God. The fact that they are found on all the surfaces of the sanctuary means that both the holy place and the most holy place were conceived unitarily as the court of God's throne.</p>

                <summary>18. How do we understand the fact that Hebrews 9:12 speaks of Jesus having entered the most holy place already at His resurrection?</summary>
                <div class="details-content">
                    <p>In light of what we have seen about the nature of the Letter to the Hebrews and the unity of the sanctuary as God's court, this fact would not pose any problem. The biblical text, however, does not say this. If the problem arises, it is only the result of a misunderstanding by some translators: since the text mentions the blood of calves and goats that were used together on the Day of Atonement, some translators (including those of the New Revised Standard Version, while the traditional Revised Version, like the New King James Version and other versions, correctly reports "sanctuary") thought that Hebrews wanted to compare Jesus to the high priest who, on the Day of Atonement, entered the most holy place, and so they translated it that way. Things are different: in 9:1-3, three different words are used in relation to the sanctuary: skené, which means tent and is used for the entire sanctuary; haghion (singular) or haghia (plural), which means "holy thing(s)" and is used both for the entire sanctuary (v. 1) and only for the first room, the holy place (v. 2). Haghia haghion, which literally means "the holy of holies," that is, "the most holy things," is used in v. 3 to describe the most holy place. It is thus seen that Hebrews knows how to distinguish the holy from the most holy when it wants to do so, but it never uses this latter term to describe the place where Jesus performs His ministry in the heavenly sanctuary. This fact can simply mean that the writer wants to describe Jesus as the fulfiller of the symbols of the heavenly sanctuary as a whole (we have already seen this) without specifically emphasizing the particular meaning of the most holy place. Thus, in 9:12, Jesus does not enter the haghia haghion, but simply the haghia, the holy places in general. On the other hand, even on the Day of Atonement, the high priest performed his service throughout the sanctuary, in both rooms and also in the courtyard, because everything had to be purified (Leviticus 16:15-19; Exodus 30:1,10). In the same way, Jesus performs His service throughout the sanctuary, not just in the most holy place. If Hebrews had wanted to compare Jesus to the specific task of the high priest on the Day of Atonement, it could have explicitly mentioned the expression haghia haghion, which it does not do.</p>
                    
                    <p>For convenience, we report the context of Hebrews 9:12 providing the original Greek terms: "8 The Holy Spirit was showing by this that the way into the sanctuary (aghion) had not yet been disclosed as long as the first tabernacle (skené) was still standing. 9 This is an illustration for the present time, indicating that the gifts and sacrifices being offered were not able to clear the conscience of the worshiper. 10 They are only a matter of food and drink and various ceremonial washings—external regulations applying until the time of the new order. 11 But when Christ came as high priest of the good things that are now already here, he went through the greater and more perfect tabernacle (skené) that is not made with human hands, that is to say, is not a part of this creation. 12 He did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves; but he entered the sanctuary (aghia=holy places) once for all by his own blood, thus obtaining eternal redemption."</p>

                <summary>19. How can we understand Hebrews 9:8? Does it perhaps mean that only the Most Holy Place of the earthly sanctuary truly represented the heavenly ministry of Jesus?</summary>
                <div class="details-content">
                    <p>Since in the previous verses (6,7) Hebrews has contrasted the holy place, where priests enter continually, with the most holy place where only the high priest enters once a year, some scholars think that in v. 8 Hebrews is contrasting the holy place as a symbol of the old covenant, while the most holy place would be the symbol of the new covenant of which Jesus is minister.</p>
                    
                    <p>We can admit that reading only vv. 6,7 could also lead to such a conclusion, but the general context does not allow us to do so. Hebrews sufficiently clarifies that the contrast is always made between the entire sanctuary of the Old Testament and the heavenly one.</p>
                    
                    <ol class="styled-list">
                        <li>We can see this clearly in 8:1-5 where we read that Jesus is our minister in the heavenly sanctuary symbolized by the entire Mosaic sanctuary.</li>
                        <li>In 9:1-3 we are explained that the Mosaic sanctuary was composed of the holy place and the most holy place. The discussion on the sanctuary in Hebrews 8 concludes with the teaching that the old (all the old) is about to disappear to make way for the new (all the new). (To illustrate the symbolic meaning of the earthly sanctuary as a shadow of Christ, reference is also made to the order of construction given by God, and this order, in the Old Testament texts to which Paul refers, includes everything concerning the Israelite sanctuary).</li>
                        <li>Similarly, in 9:8, Hebrews says, after having described the entire ancient sanctuary, that all this (not just the holy place) was about to disappear to make way for the reality of the new. In 9:8, the sanctuary, haghion, is the entire heavenly sanctuary, as in 9:1 it refers to the entire earthly sanctuary. The first tabernacle, skene, of which Hebrews 9:8 speaks, thus refers to the entire earthly sanctuary and not to just one part of it. Hebrews 8:9 clarifies that skene and haghion are just synonyms, so that it appears clear that as the Jewish priests ministered in the entire earthly sanctuary (whatever the word used to refer to this fact), so Jesus ministers in the entire heavenly sanctuary.</li>

                <summary>20. In what sense do Adventists believe in the existence of a heavenly sanctuary? Is it a material house in which God lives?</summary>
                <div class="details-content">
                    <p>The Bible teaches that God asked Moses to build a sanctuary according to the model that was shown to him (Exodus 25:9). This model would represent the heavenly sanctuary (Hebrews 8:5). Evidently, this does not mean that we must imagine the heavenly sanctuary as if it had the same dimensions, the same structure, and was made with the same materials as the earthly one. Not even the magnificent temple of Solomon could represent the glory of the heavenly sanctuary (1 Kings 8:27). The "model" was such not by virtue of its physical representation but by virtue of the spiritual meaning it wanted to express.</p>
                    
                    <p>On the other hand, even if with Solomon we can say that the heaven of heavens cannot contain God, we understand nevertheless that, in His grace, God comes into contact with His creatures; and since these are limited in time and space, God must manifest Himself in time and space. Consequently, there must be a place in the universe where God's presence manifests itself to His creatures: we can call this place "heavenly sanctuary" whatever its form and structure, its substance and its glory. There Jesus represents us before the heavenly Father, and there, in faith, we can already now find ourselves together with Him.</p>

                <summary>21. By saying that the heavenly sanctuary must be purified, aren't we transferring a negative quality into the perfection of heaven? How can heaven be contaminated?</summary>
                <div class="details-content">
                    <p>The problem posed is not solved by denying a reality clearly affirmed in scripture. That the earthly sanctuary could be contaminated by the sins of the people is implicit in the very reality of the day of purifications: if there were no contamination, there would be no need for purification. That this is also necessary for the heavenly sanctuary is clearly affirmed in the New Testament: "It was necessary, then, for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these" (Hebrews 9:23). Our task is therefore not to discuss the fact but to understand its meaning.</p>
                    
                    <p>The problem of the contamination of the heavenly sanctuary is partly a problem of language because the ancients understood this concept in a partially different way from us. In the realm of faith, for us, contamination is above all a moral fact, even if, in the medical field, it retains a physical meaning ("contaminated by a virus"). These two meanings are found in biblical language with, in addition, also a ritual meaning. The concept of contamination can also coexist with a morally good reality that is nevertheless touched by evil and could be weakened by it. For example, a man is contaminated by the touch of a reptile (Leviticus 11:44), a Nazirite can be contaminated by even the incidental touch of a dead person (Numbers 6:8,9): generally, a washing solves the problem. If we want to understand, we must translate the substance of biblical language into a language that is closer to us.</p>
                    
                    <p>In the writer's opinion, the contamination of heavenly realities can be understood fundamentally in two ways:</p>
                    
                    <ol class="styled-list">
                        <li>The contamination of the sanctuary consists, not so much in the contamination of the place as such, but in the state of contamination, of weakness, of imperfection of the people that the sanctuary represents. As the purification of the heavenly sanctuary coincided with the purification of the people of Israel, so the purification of the heavenly sanctuary represents that of God's people of all times. Heaven and earth are connected realities, and God's people on earth, through their faith and God's grace, are not separated from heaven. In faith, they have access to God's heavenly throne, where they go, thanks to Christ's mediation, with their sins and imperfections (Hebrews 4:14). This does not mean that heaven is imperfect, in the same way that the fact that Jesus lived for a time in contact with sinners did not make Him a sinner. Before the death of Christ, Satan himself had access to heaven, but this did not prevent heaven itself from being considered pure and holy. It may perhaps help to understand, the fact that the sacrifice for sin, which also received the confessed sin, still remained a most holy thing (Leviticus 10:17).</li>
                        
                        <li>The contamination of the sanctuary as the presence of the memory of sin. As in the earthly sanctuary, a reminder of sins remained, so it happens in heavenly realities through the books of human affairs. These juridical memories must be taken away, but their presence does not mean that heaven is imperfect or evil. Think of the Bible. The Lord would certainly have wanted to give us a revelation totally exempt from references to sin and evil. The many stories of sin that are narrated in it "contaminate" in a sense its purity. Yet it continues to be holy. The same is true for the heavenly Sanctuary: the memory of our sins also deprives heaven of the joy of a totally holy reality, but this does not make heaven less holy. The day of purification is not intended to make heaven more holy and perfect, but to reveal and reaffirm its unchanged and never diminished holiness.</li>
