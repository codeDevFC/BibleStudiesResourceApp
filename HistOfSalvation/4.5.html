            <h2>Purpose:</h2>
            <p>To free Christian faith from the idea that the church can be founded on a human being and to reaffirm Christ's exclusive position as the foundation of the church.</p>

        <!-- Introduction Section -->
<div class="introduction-box">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>We have so much in common with Catholic believers, but there are also many differences that we cannot honestly ignore. One of the most important concerns authority within the church. The Catholic Church teaches that Jesus gave the church a visible head in Peter and his successors (the bishops of Rome) as the "rock" upon which all Christianity should stand. Instead, we believe that the foundation stone of the church is not a man but Jesus Himself, and that we find reliable guidance in God's Word. Let's see what the Bible says.</p>

        <div class="explanation-box">
            <p>The text is complex, and here we offer a traditional explanation. To understand what Jesus meant, we must consider both immediate and general context:</p>

                <div class="point-card">
                    <h3>A. The Temple Analogy</h3>
                    <p>Jesus is comparing the Christian Church to a solid temple built on rock.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="point-card">
                    <h3>B. Living Stones</h3>
                    <p>The apostle Paul, using a similar image, says this temple is made of living stones, people who accept Jesus as their savior (<span class="scripture-reference">Ephesians 2:18-22</span>). He also says Jesus is the cornerstone from which this temple is built. The apostle Peter offers the same teaching (<span class="scripture-reference">1 Peter 2:2-8</span>).</p>
                </div>

                <div class="point-card">
                    <h3>C. Becoming a Stone</h3>
                    <p>Following this image, used by both Christ and the apostles, a person becomes a stone in the church when accepting Jesus as Savior who comes from God. Peter had just confessed this (<span class="scripture-reference">Matthew 16:16</span>), and it's this testimony of faith that allows Jesus to define Peter as a "petros," a stone in His church.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="point-card">
                    <h3>D. Word Choice Significance</h3>
                    <p>This doesn't mean Peter is the Rock on which the church is founded. If Jesus had wanted to say this, He would have said: "You are petros and on this petros I will build my church." Instead, He says: "You are petros (meaning 'stone, rock') and on this petra (meaning 'solid rock') I will build my church."</p>

                <div class="point-card">
                    <h3>E. Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>The rock on which the Christian church stands is not a man but Christ Himself, whom we must recognize and confess, following Peter's example, as Messiah, the Savior, Son of the living God.</p>

                    <li>17 fathers say the rock is Peter</li>

    <h2>5. In John 20:19-23, the Risen Christ Gave the Disciples the Privilege to Forgive or Retain Sins. Doesn't This Give Bishops and Priests Special Authority?</h2>

        <div class="point-block">
            <h3>A. Collective Authority</h3>
            <p>We don't believe so. As with the Matthew text already considered, we note here that Jesus doesn't attribute any privilege to one or a few people, but to all who believe in Him. In this John text, Jesus isn't addressing only Peter or the apostles, but all disciples gathered in the room, including the two who had met Jesus on the road to Emmaus (<span class="scripture-reference">Luke 24:33</span>).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="point-block">
            <h3>B. Gospel Connection</h3>
            <p>Once again, as with previous texts, what Jesus says about forgiving sins is correlated to gospel preaching (<span class="scripture-reference">John 18:21</span>). Thus, Jesus gave all disciples not arbitrary power to decide who should or shouldn't be forgiven, but the privilege and responsibility to share with others the knowledge of the gospel that alone can save from sin's condemnation.</p>

                <p>Peter was chosen to represent Jesus by giving testimony of His life and teaching (<span class="scripture-reference">Luke 6:13; Acts 1:21,22</span>): he has the apostolic authority of being an authorized witness of Jesus. However, he shares this authority with other apostles.</p>

        <h3>Apostolic Requirements:</h3>
        <p>What made apostles special was their particular relationship with Jesus. As we know from their own history and the procedure adopted in <span class="scripture-reference">Acts 1:21-26</span> to seek Judas's replacement, they had to:</p>
        
        <ol class="requirements-list">
            <li>Be eyewitnesses of Jesus' ministry</li>
            <li>Be chosen directly by Him</li>

        <div class="important-note">
            <p>Neither the pope nor bishops present these characteristics and cannot be considered apostolic successors. The Bible doesn't provide for any papal function, and as for bishops, also called "elders" (<span class="scripture-reference">Acts 20:17, 28; 1 Timothy 4:14</span>), theirs is a ministry different from the apostolic one.</p>

        <p>The apostles' main purpose was to testify to Jesus' teaching. As such, their ministry doesn't end with their death. Their teaching was written down and is still available to us today. The Bible is the word of prophets (Old Testament) and apostles (New Testament). By listening to the Bible, we honor the ministry the Lord entrusted to these people and become part of Jesus' true church.</p>

                        <p>If Matthew, an apostle of Jesus perfectly capable of understanding any Aramaic used by the Lord, chose to distinguish the two words, this means he:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Recognized the possibility of misunderstanding the Master's words</li>
