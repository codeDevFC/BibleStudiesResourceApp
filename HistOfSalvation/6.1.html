        <div class="question">
            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>To help understand the doctrine of the earthly sanctuary as a symbol of the plan of salvation centered in Christ. To show how the Lord taught and offered this plan even before the incarnation and death of Jesus. In this study, we will examine the service that took place in the courtyard and in the holy place, the service called "the continual," to prepare the way to understand the annual service of the day of atonement.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Not many Christians know the biblical teaching regarding the sanctuary. Yet it is something so important that, in addition to many other texts, two books of the Bible are almost entirely dedicated to it (Leviticus and Hebrews). Through the sanctuary, we know how God manifested His grace to sinners of the Old Testament and what is the meaning of salvation in Christ. The sanctuary helps us look to Jesus as our high priest and gives us confidence and hope.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h3>Introductory Elements</h3>
            <ol class="styled-list">
                <li>The Bible teaches that the consequence of sin is death. <span class="bible-reference">Romans 6:23</span></li>
                <li>Salvation and eternal life are offered through Jesus Christ. <span class="bible-reference">Romans 6:23</span></li>
                <li>How could this salvation be represented and offered before the incarnation and sacrifice of Jesus?</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>From the beginning of human history, believers learned to express their faith in the coming of a Savior by offering sacrifices to God.</p>
            
            <p><span class="bible-reference">Genesis 3:7,21</span> tells us that after the first sin, the man and woman felt uncomfortable in their own minds and with the world around them. To remedy this situation, they covered themselves with fig leaves, a symbol of the inadequacy of human solutions to the problem of sin. What they needed was something more substantial than fig leaves, a durable "garment" that could truly cover their physical and spiritual "nakedness." To achieve this purpose, an animal was sacrificed and its skin used as a tunic. This was the first sacrifice: the life of an innocent being was offered to cover man's guilt and give him hope and security. God Himself offered this sacrifice, and it represents the gift that God would make of His Son on the cross as a sacrifice for salvation from our sins.</p>
            
            <p>Abel offered animal sacrifices to God <span class="bible-reference">(Genesis 4:4)</span> and the patriarchs continued this practice <span class="bible-reference">(Genesis 31:54)</span>. Many times these sacrifices are offered as a sign of gratitude to God, but sometimes their purpose is to ask for forgiveness of a committed sin <span class="bible-reference">(Job 1:5)</span>. At the beginning, everyone could offer their personal sacrifice wherever they were, but when Israel became God's people, He gave precise instructions on how and where to do it. The essential element of these norms was that the sacrifice could be offered only in one place, the sanctuary, which God commanded Moses to build <span class="bible-reference">(Exodus 25:8)</span>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h3>General Meaning of the Sanctuary</h3>
            
            <h4>4. After liberating them from slavery in Egypt, God asked His people to build a sanctuary, a tent intended for sacred use. What was its fundamental purpose?</h4>
            
            <span class="scripture-reference">Exodus 25:8,9</span>
            <p>The sanctuary represented God's desire to share the life of His people, to assure them of His presence and love. Since at that time Israel lived in tents, the sanctuary was also a tent. When the people moved, God's tent moved with them, a wonderful symbol of Jesus who comes to stay with us and live our life. It's worth noting a special meaning of that tent: God Himself and not the people decides how it should be: it's God who decides how His people should be and what the way of salvation is. When Israel became sedentary and politically stable, Solomon built a temple in masonry, but the basic structure remained the same. However, even Solomon was aware of the limitations of that temple: however splendid, that building was only a pale reflection of God's true house, the temple in heaven <span class="bible-reference">(2 Chronicles 6:18-23)</span>. "The LORD is in his holy temple; the LORD's throne is in heaven; his eyes see, his eyelids test the children of man" <span class="bible-reference">(Psalm 11:4. See also 103:19; Isaiah 66:1)</span>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h3>5. How does the New Testament consider the sanctuary and its rites?</h3>
            
            <span class="scripture-reference">Hebrews 8:1-5</span>
            <p>The letter to the Hebrews clarifies the spiritual and symbolic meaning of Israel's sanctuary: it was only a shadow, a parable, a symbol of the heavenly reality, and what happened there was a symbol of what Jesus would one day do for our salvation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h3>6. What was the sanctuary like?</h3>

                <img src="/HistOfSalvation/images/Sanctuary.png" alt="Diagram of the Sanctuary" />
            </div>
            
            <p>The complete description is found in Exodus 25-27, but Hebrews 9:1-5 offers us a summary (for the censer, see point 3 of paragraph a. below). It was divided into two rooms: the first was called the holy place, the second the most holy place or the holy of holies <span class="bible-reference">(Exodus 26:30-34)</span>.</p>

                        <p>(In Hebrews 9:1 it is said that this altar belonged to the most holy place.

Ancient peoples used to place their treaties, their laws, at the feet of their gods, calling them to be their custodians and witnesses of their faithful observance. This means that the Decalogue was the fundamental law of the covenant between God and Israel, and that Israel committed to observe it faithfully. God would be a witness to any of their transgressions. The decalogue was therefore called the "testimony" <span class="bible-reference">(Exodus 25:21)</span> and the ark was called "the ark of the testimony" <span class="bible-reference">(Exodus 25:22)</span>.</p>

                <h3>The Sin Offerings</h3>
                <h4>9. Many different types of sacrifices were offered in the sanctuary. However, the most important were those for sin.</h4>
                
                <ol class="styled-list">
                    <li>The sinner had to become aware of his sin and offer a sacrifice <span class="bible-reference">(Leviticus 5:5,6)</span>.</li>
                    <li>He had to confess his sin <span class="bible-reference">(Leviticus 5:5)</span>. Note that sin was not confessed to a priest but directly to God.</li>
                    <li>He had to place a hand on the head of the sacrifice <span class="bible-reference">(Leviticus 4:4,15,24,29)</span>. In this way, he identified himself with the animal that died taking his place. Other texts allow us to understand that this laying on of hands coincided with the confession of sins <span class="bible-reference">(Leviticus 16:20-22)</span>. Every time hands are laid on someone, it is always to transfer something to them. It could be a blessing on children <span class="bible-reference">(Genesis 48:14,20)</span> or, in the case of a consecration, the authority to perform the assigned office <span class="bible-reference">(Acts 13:2,3)</span>. In the case of confession of sin, what was transmitted was the sin itself, and the animal died for the sinner's sin.</li>
                    <li>It was the sinner himself who had to kill the animal. Applying all this to our relationship with Jesus, we understand that our Savior was not put to death only by the Jews or the Romans because we are all morally responsible for His death: our sins killed Him <span class="bible-reference">(Isaiah 53:5; 1 Corinthians 15:3)</span>.</li>

                <h3>The Priests</h3>
                <h4>12. Who helped the sinner present his sacrifice before God?</h4>
                
                <p>After the sacrifice was offered by the sinner, it had to be presented before God in the sanctuary, but the sinner could not enter it. There was therefore a need for a mediator, and this was the role played by the priests. There were two ways in which the sin offering could be presented before God:</p>
                
                <ol class="styled-list">
                    <li>Through the blood brought into the sanctuary <span class="bible-reference">(Leviticus 4:5,6,16)</span>. This happened, however, only in the most important cases; the entire people or the (high) priest who represented them.</li>
                    <li>For most sacrifices, those of common individuals, the sacrifice was brought directly into the sanctuary by the priests who ate its flesh in the holy place <span class="bible-reference">(Leviticus 10:17,18)</span>.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
    
            <div class="question">
                <h3>13. Why did the sacrifice have to be brought inside the sanctuary?</h3>
                
                <ol class="styled-list">
                    <li>A first answer is that this had to be done simply because it was being presented to God whose presence was manifested in the sanctuary.</li>
                    <li>But the text of Leviticus 10:17,18 emphasizes another aspect. If in the courtyard it was the sinner himself who offered the sacrifice, it was then brought inside the sanctuary, into God's presence, by a mediator: the priest. In this way, the priest took charge of the sin that had been forgiven and removed from the penitent sinner. In some way, he took it and carried it upon himself into the sanctuary to complete the process of atonement.</li>

                <h3>The Continual</h3>
                
                <p>Everything we have seen happening so far in the earthly sanctuary and in the heavenly one has a permanent value. Every day the Hebrews could confess their sins and offer their sacrifices; we can do the same through Jesus who, in the heavenly sanctuary, "always lives to make intercession" for us <span class="bible-reference">(Hebrews 7:25. See also 13:15)</span>.</p>
                
                <p>All these services, along with others, such as the collective sacrifices of morning and evening <span class="bible-reference">(Numbers 28:4)</span>, took place in the courtyard and in the holy place, the first room of the sanctuary <span class="bible-reference">(Hebrews 9:6)</span>.</p>
                
                <p>Thus a correspondence is established between the courtyard and the holy place with the service that is called "continual" (Among these continual rites there was naturally more, such as the burnt offerings of morning and evening, <span class="bible-reference">Exodus 29:38-42</span>). In the next study, we will see what kind of service takes place instead in the most holy place and discover the extraordinariness of its meaning, which refers to something that happens only once in history.</p>
