But those who are counted worthy to attain that age, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage; nor can they die anymore, for they are equal to the angels and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.'"

                <p>Angels are spiritual beings who do not marry or reproduce as humans do. They are immortal—they "cannot die anymore." While they can take physical form when necessary to interact with humans, their natural state is spiritual rather than physical.</p>
                
                <p>This passage also gives us insight into our future resurrected state, when we will be "equal to the angels" in certain respects, particularly in having immortal, spiritual bodies not subject to death or the need for reproduction.</p>

                    <p>"Then Jacob departed from Beersheba and went toward Haran. He came to a certain place and spent the night there, because the sun had set; and he took one of the stones of the place and put it under his head, and lay down in that place. He had a dream, and behold, a ladder was set on the earth with its top reaching to heaven; and behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it. And behold, the LORD stood above it and said, 'I am the LORD, the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac; the land on which you lie, I will give it to you and to your descendants... Behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land; for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.' Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, 'Surely the LORD is in this place, and I did not know it.'" (Genesis 28:10-16)</p>

                <p>Jacob perceived angels as messengers traveling between heaven and earth, carrying out God's purposes. In his dream, he saw angels "ascending and descending" on a ladder between heaven and earth, revealing that God's messengers are actively engaged in human affairs.</p>
                
                <p>This vision gave Jacob assurance of God's presence and protection during his journey. Similarly, angels can help us by:</p>
                <ul class="styled-list">
                    <li>Providing protection in times of danger</li>
                    <li>Delivering guidance or messages from God</li>
                    <li>Offering encouragement and strength in difficult circumstances</li>
                    <li>Serving as a reminder of God's constant care and involvement in our lives</li>

                <p>Jacob's response—"Surely the LORD is in this place, and I did not know it"—reminds us that God's presence and angelic activity often occur without our awareness.</p>

                </div>
                
                <p>Jesus identifies Himself as the fulfillment of Jacob's ladder. He is the connection between heaven and earth, the mediator between God and humanity. Just as the ladder in Jacob's dream provided a way for angels to move between heaven and earth, Jesus provides the way for communication and relationship between God and humans.</p>
                
                <p>This reveals an important truth: angelic ministry operates through and because of Christ. The work of angels in our lives is part of Christ's mediatorial role. They serve at His command and operate within His authority as the one who bridges the gap between heaven and earth.</p>
                
                <p>This also helps us understand that we don't need to seek angels directly—we have direct access to God through Christ, who coordinates all heavenly ministry on our behalf.</p>

                    <p>"And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted his eyes and looked, and behold, a Man stood opposite him with His sword drawn in His hand. And Joshua went to Him and said to Him, 'Are You for us or for our adversaries?' So He said, 'No, but as Commander of the army of the LORD I have now come.' And Joshua fell on his face to the earth and worshiped, and said to Him, 'What does my Lord say to His servant?' Then the Commander of the LORD's army said to Joshua, 'Take your sandal off your foot, for the place where you stand is holy.' And Joshua did so." (Joshua 5:13-15)</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>Compare this text with Exodus 3:2-6 (This is a very special "angel." He is called "The Angel of God" and asks to be worshiped as God. He is Jesus, the Son of God and God Himself. He is always called the angel and not an angel of God because He is unique. He is called "angel" because this word means "messenger" and Jesus is God's Messenger par excellence, His very word (John 1:1).</p>
                
                <p>The Commander of the LORD's army who appeared to Joshua accepted worship and declared the ground holy—responses that would be inappropriate for a created angel but fitting for deity. This, along with similar Old Testament appearances, points to Jesus Christ in a pre-incarnate form.</p>
                
                <p>As the eternal Son of God, Jesus has always been the head of the angelic hosts, commanding their activities and receiving their worship. This helps us understand the hierarchy of heaven—all angels, regardless of rank, ultimately answer to Christ.</p>

                <p>These passages clearly show that angels refuse worship. When John fell down to worship the angel who had shown him these revelations, the angel immediately corrected him, directing him to "Worship God" instead.</p>
                
                <p>Angels understand their role as servants of God, not objects of worship. They recognize that worship belongs to God alone. This stands in stark contrast to Satan, who seeks worship that rightfully belongs only to God (Matthew 4:9).</p>
                
                <p>This teaching protects us from the error of angel worship, which has appeared in various forms throughout history. True angels will always direct our attention and devotion to God rather than to themselves.</p>

                <p>They are our friends but, to avoid transforming them into gods, which they do not desire at all, we direct our prayers only to God, their and our Lord.

                <p>Scripture consistently directs our prayers to God alone. Jesus taught us to pray "Our Father in heaven" (Matthew 6:9), not to angels or saints. While angels serve us, they do not receive or answer prayers—this is God's prerogative alone.</p>
                
                <p>This distinction preserves the proper order of creation and prevents confusion about the role of angels. They are messengers and servants, not mediators between us and God. Christ alone fills that mediatorial role (1 Timothy 2:5).</p>

                    <p>Hebrews 1:14 allows us to think this: "Are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister for those who will inherit salvation?"</p>
                    
                    <p>The early Christians thought so: "Then they said to her, 'You are beside yourself!' Yet she kept insisting that it was so. So they said, 'It is his angel.'" (Acts 12:15)</p>
                    
                    <p>When Peter was miraculously released from prison and knocked at the door where believers were praying for him, they initially thought it was "his angel"—suggesting a belief in personal guardian angels.</p>
                    
                    <p>While the Bible doesn't explicitly teach that each person has an assigned guardian angel, several passages suggest that angels do watch over believers:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="styled-list">
                        <li>Psalm 91:11-12: "For He shall give His angels charge over you, to keep you in all your ways. In their hands they shall bear you up, lest you dash your foot against a stone."</li>
                        <li>Matthew 18:10: "Take heed that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I say to you that in heaven their angels always see the face of My Father who is in heaven."</li>

                    <p>Whether God assigns specific angels to individuals or simply sends angels as needed, the biblical teaching is clear that God uses angels to protect and guide His people. The focus should remain on God's care for us rather than on identifying or communicating with specific guardian angels.</p>

                    <p>The law was "appointed through angels by the hand of a mediator." Angels played a role in the giving of the Law at Mount Sinai, highlighting the solemnity and divine authority of God's commandments.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>1 Peter 1:12</strong> - Angels long to understand the plan of salvation.</p>
                    <p>"Things which angels desire to look into." Angels, though present at creation and involved in God's work throughout history, do not fully comprehend the mystery of salvation. They observe with wonder as God's redemptive plan unfolds through Christ and the church.</p>
                    
                    <p>These additional insights reveal that angels are not omniscient—they continue to learn about God's ways. They serve as witnesses to God's work in human history, particularly His plan of redemption through Christ. Their interest in our salvation reminds us of the profound significance of what God has done for us in Christ.</p>
