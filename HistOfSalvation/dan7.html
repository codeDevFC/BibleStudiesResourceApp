            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>To understand the prophetic vision of Daniel 7, which reveals the rise of four world kingdoms, the emergence of a special power that opposes God's law, and the divine judgment that will ultimately establish God's eternal kingdom.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>In our previous study, we examined Daniel 2 and the prophetic dream of Nebuchadnezzar about four world empires. Now in Daniel 7, we find a parallel prophecy that provides additional details about these kingdoms and introduces a special power that would arise after them. This chapter also reveals the solemn judgment scene in heaven that precedes the establishment of God's eternal kingdom.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h3>1. Daniel's Vision of Four Beasts</h3>
            <span class="scripture-reference">Daniel 7:1-8</span>
            
            <p>In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel had a vision in which he saw four great beasts coming up from the sea. Each beast was different from the others and represented a kingdom that would arise on earth.</p>

                    <p><span class="bible-reference">(Daniel 7:4)</span> "The first was like a lion, and it had the wings of an eagle. I watched until its wings were torn off and it was lifted from the ground so that it stood on two feet like a human being, and the mind of a human was given to it."</p>
                    <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> This beast represents Babylon, corresponding to the head of gold in Daniel 2. The lion was a common symbol of Babylon, and archaeological findings show winged lions as decorations in Babylonian palaces. The plucking of its wings and being made to stand as a man may represent Nebuchadnezzar's humbling experience in Daniel 4.</p>

                    <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> This beast represents Medo-Persia, corresponding to the chest and arms of silver in Daniel 2. The bear being raised on one side indicates that one part of the kingdom (Persia) was stronger than the other (Media). The three ribs likely represent the three major conquests: Lydia, Babylon, and Egypt.</p>

                    <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> This beast represents Greece under Alexander the Great, corresponding to the belly and thighs of bronze in Daniel 2. The four wings symbolize the incredible speed with which Alexander conquered the known world. The four heads represent the four divisions of the empire after Alexander's death: Macedonia under Cassander, Thrace under Lysimachus, Syria under Seleucus, and Egypt under Ptolemy.</p>

                    <p><span class="bible-reference">(Daniel 7:7-8)</span> "After that, in my vision at night I looked, and there before me was a fourth beast—terrifying and frightening and very powerful. It had large iron teeth; it crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. It was different from all the former beasts, and it had ten horns. While I was thinking about the horns, there before me was another horn, a little one, which came up among them; and three of the first horns were uprooted before it. This horn had eyes like the eyes of a human being and a mouth that spoke boastfully."</p>
                    <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> This beast represents Rome, corresponding to the legs of iron in Daniel 2. Its iron teeth parallel the iron legs of the image. The ten horns represent the divisions of the Roman Empire after its fall, corresponding to the ten toes of the image in Daniel 2.</p>

            <h3>2. The Little Horn Power</h3>
            <span class="scripture-reference">Daniel 7:8, 20-25</span>
            
            <p>Among the ten horns of the fourth beast, Daniel saw "another horn, a little one" arise. This little horn represents a special power with unique characteristics:</p>
            
            <ol class="styled-list">
                <li>It came up among the ten horns (arose among the divided Roman Empire)</li>
                <li>It uprooted three of the original ten horns</li>
                <li>It had eyes like the eyes of a man (human leadership)</li>
                <li>It had a mouth speaking pompous words (blasphemous claims)</li>
                <li>It made war against the saints and prevailed against them (persecution)</li>
                <li>It intended to change times and law (alteration of God's commandments)</li>
                <li>The saints were given into its hand for "a time and times and half a time" (3½ prophetic years or 1260 literal years)</li>

                <p>What religious-political power arose after the fall of the Roman Empire that matches all these identifying characteristics?</p>

            <ul class="styled-list">
                <li>Rose to power after the fall of Rome, among the divided kingdoms</li>
                <li>Uprooted three kingdoms that opposed its religious authority (Heruli, Vandals, and Ostrogoths)</li>
                <li>Has a visible human leader who claims to be God's representative on earth</li>
                <li>Has made claims that belong only to God (power to forgive sins, infallibility)</li>
                <li>Persecuted those who maintained biblical faith contrary to its teachings during the Middle Ages</li>
                <li>Made changes to God's law, including transferring the sanctity of the seventh-day Sabbath to Sunday</li>
                <li>Exercised dominant power from approximately 538 CE (when the last of the three opposing kingdoms was uprooted) to 1798 CE (when the pope was taken captive by Napoleon's general Berthier), exactly 1260 years</li>

        <div class="question">
            <h3>3. The Heavenly Judgment Scene</h3>
            <span class="scripture-reference">Daniel 7:9-14</span>
            
            <div class="scripture-box">
                <p>"As I looked, thrones were set in place, and the Ancient of Days took his seat. His clothing was as white as snow; the hair of his head was white like wool. His throne was flaming with fire, and its wheels were all ablaze. A river of fire was flowing, coming out from before him. Thousands upon thousands attended him; ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him. The court was seated, and the books were opened." (Daniel 7:9-10)</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>After describing the four beasts and the little horn, Daniel's vision shifts to a solemn scene of judgment in heaven:</p>
            
            <ul class="styled-list">
                <li>The Ancient of Days (God the Father) is seated on His throne</li>
                <li>His appearance is described in terms of absolute purity and majesty</li>
                <li>Countless angels attend Him as witnesses</li>
                <li>The court is seated and the books are opened</li>
                <li>The little horn power is judged and its dominion taken away</li>
                <li>One like the Son of Man (Jesus Christ) comes to the Ancient of Days</li>
                <li>Christ receives an everlasting dominion and kingdom</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>This judgment scene occurs in heaven before the second coming of Christ. It corresponds to the cleansing of the sanctuary described in Daniel 8 and the pre-advent investigative judgment in which the cases of all who have professed faith in God are examined.</p>
            
            <p>The sequence of events is significant:</p>
            <ol class="styled-list">
                <li>The judgment begins while the little horn power is still active on earth</li>
                <li>The judgment results in the little horn's dominion being taken away</li>
                <li>After the judgment, Christ receives His kingdom</li>
                <li>The saints of the Most High then receive the kingdom</li>
            </ol>
            
            <div class="scripture-box">
                <p>"I kept looking because of the sound of the boastful words which the horn was speaking; I kept looking until the beast was slain, and its body was destroyed and given to the burning fire... I kept looking in the night visions, and behold, with the clouds of heaven One like a Son of Man was coming, and He came up to the Ancient of Days and was presented before Him. And to Him was given dominion, glory and a kingdom, that all the peoples, nations and men of every language might serve Him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion which will not pass away; and His kingdom is one which will not be destroyed." (Daniel 7:11, 13-14)</p>

            <h3>4. The Interpretation of the Vision</h3>
            <span class="scripture-reference">Daniel 7:15-27</span>
            
            <p>Daniel was troubled by the vision and asked for its interpretation. An angel explained:</p>

                    <p>The four beasts represent four successive world empires, just as in Nebuchadnezzar's dream in Daniel 2. The final outcome is that God's people will ultimately receive an everlasting kingdom.</p>

(Daniel 7:19-20)</p>
                    <p>The angel explains that the fourth beast is a fourth kingdom on earth, different from all other kingdoms, which will devour the whole earth and trample it down. The ten horns are ten kings who will arise from this kingdom, and the little horn is another king who will arise after them, different from the previous ones, who will subdue three kings.</p>

                    <p>God is in control of history and has revealed its course in advance. The precise fulfillment of this prophecy regarding the succession of world empires confirms the divine inspiration of Scripture and strengthens our faith in God's sovereignty.</p>

                    <h4><i class="fas fa-balance-scale"></i> Truth Matters</h4>
                    <p>A religious power would arise that would attempt to change God's law and persecute His faithful people. This reminds us of the importance of knowing and following God's truth rather than human traditions that may contradict Scripture.</p>

                    <p>God's judgment will ultimately vindicate His people and His law. Though evil powers may temporarily prevail, God will bring all to account and establish justice.</p>
